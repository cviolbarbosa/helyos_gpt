# Autonomous Driving Application with Large Language Model Reasoning

## Overview
This repository integrates the Helyos framework with GPT to create advanced autonomous driving applications that respond to natural language.

## Key Components
- **GPT-proxy**: An HTTP microservice that connects to a large language model.
- **Assistant**: An AMQP service that dispatches and monitors requests generated by the GPT model.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduces human intervention in organizing complex missions and handling failures.
- **Accessibility**: Provides a user interface with minimal training.

## Challenges
- **Cost and Privacy**: Replace GPT-4 with an self-hosted open-source smaller model.
